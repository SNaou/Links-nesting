<h1> Reddit </h1>
Reddit this an American social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion website. 
Registered users (commonly referred to as "Redditors") submit content to the site such as links, text posts, images, 
and videos, which are then voted up or down by other members. Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called 
"communities" or "subreddits". Submissions with more upvotes appear towards the top of their subreddit and, if they receive enough 
upvotes, ultimately on the site's front page. Reddit administrators moderate the communities. Moderation is also conducted by 
community-specific moderators, who are not Reddit employees

<h2> Site overvieuw </h2>
<p> Reddit is a website comprising user-generated content—including photos, videos, links, and text-based posts—and 
    discussions of this content in what is essentially a bulletin board system.</p>
<p> As a network of communities, Reddit's core content consists of posts from its users.Users can comment on others' posts 
    to continue the conversation.A key feature to Reddit is that users can cast positive or negative votes, called upvotes and downvotes 
    respectively, for each post and comment on the site. The number of upvotes or downvotes determines the posts' visibility on the site,
     so the most popular content is displayed to the most people. </p>

<h2> Users and moderators </h2>
<P>Registering an account with Reddit is free and does not require an email address.In addition to commenting and voting, registered users 
    can also create their own subreddit on a topic of their choosing. In Reddit style, usernames begin with "u/". For example, noteworthy 
    redditors include</P>
<p>Subreddits are overseen by moderators, Reddit users who earn the title by creating a subreddit or being promoted by a current moderator.
    These moderators are volunteers who manage their communities, set and enforce community-specific rules, remove posts and comments that 
    violate these rules, and generally work to keep discussions in their subreddit on topic. Admins, by contrast, are paid to work for Reddit. </p>

<h2> Subreddits </h2>
<p>Subreddits are user-created areas of interest where discussions on Reddit are organized. There are about 138,000 active subreddits 
    (among a total of 1.2 million) as of July 2018.
    Subreddit names begin with "r/"; for instance, "r/science" is a community devoted to discussing scientific publications, 
    while "r/gaming" is a community devoted to discussing video games and "r/worldnews" is for posting news articles from around the world.</p>
<p>In a 2014 interview with Memeburn, Erik Martin, then general manager of Reddit, remarked that their "approach is to give the community 
    moderators or curators as much control as possible so that they can shape and cultivate the type of communities they want".Subreddits 
    often use themed variants of Reddit's alien mascot, Snoo, in the visual styling of their communities.</p>
